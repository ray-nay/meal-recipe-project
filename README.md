## Project Description
This project is a website application that displays to the user a list of all the available meals whose recipe they can find on the website. The project incorporates a search functionality that enables the user to search for their meal of preference. It also enables the user to be able to like their favorite meals. 

## Project SetUp 
 The project is set up in html, css and javaScript files. 

 The html page allows us to view the meals which are rendered on the browser.The meals are displayed as a set of 25 cards. To view the recipe for a meal, a user should click on the 'view recipe' button.

 The css file has been used to style the html page for a better look. 

 The javaScript file contains the codes that will enable us to achieve the functionality of each program. 
 It implements a variety of array methods as well as event listeners such as "change" and "click" which enables us to achieve specific tasks within the programs.
